Supercomputer

A supercomputer is a class of extremely powerful computers.
The term is commonly applied to the fastest high-performance systems available at any given time.
Such computers are primarily used for scientific and engineering work requiring exceedingly high-speed computations.
Common applications include testing mathematical models for complex physical phenomena or designs,
such as climate and weather, the evolution of the cosmos, nuclear weapons and reactors,
new chemical compounds (especially for pharmaceutical purposes), and cryptology.
As the cost of supercomputing declined in the 1990s,
businesses began to use supercomputers for market research and other business-related models.

Distinguishing Features

Supercomputers have certain distinguishing features.
Unlike conventional computers, they usually have more than one CPU (central processing unit),
which contains circuits for interpreting program instructions and executing arithmetic and logic operations.
The use of several CPUs achieves high computational rates, necessitated by the physical limits of circuit technology.
Electronic signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light,
imposing a fundamental speed limit for signal transmission and circuit switching.
Most supercomputers have a large storage capacity and a very fast input/output capability.
Another characteristic of supercomputers is their use of vector arithmetic—i.e.,
they can operate on pairs of lists of numbers rather than on single pairs.
For example, a typical supercomputer can multiply a list of hourly wage rates
for a group of workers by a list of hours worked in roughly the same time a
regular computer takes to process one worker’s wages.

Historical Development

Early supercomputers were built by various companies,
but Seymour Cray defined the field. Cray joined Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in 1951.
When ERA was taken over by Remington Rand, Inc., Cray left with William Norris to start
Control Data Corporation (CDC) in 1957. The Cray-designed CDC 1604 replaced vacuum tubes with
transistors and was popular in scientific labs. IBM responded with the IBM 7030, known as Stretch,
in 1961, but after financial losses, IBM temporarily withdrew from supercomputers.
In 1964, Cray’s CDC 6600 became the fastest computer, executing three million
floating-point operations per second (FLOPS), coining the term supercomputer.
Cray later founded Cray Research, Inc. (1972), followed by Cray Computer Corporation (1989).
His Cray-1, introduced in 1976, successfully implemented vector processing, and the Cray X-MP (1982)
introduced multiprocessing, linking two Cray-1 computers to triple performance.
The Cray-2 (1985) was the first to exceed one billion FLOPS.

Advancements in Supercomputing

W. Daniel Hillis proposed a new approach, eliminating the CPU bottleneck in
favor of decentralized controls. In 1983, he co-founded Thinking Machines Corporation and
introduced the CM-1 (1985), utilizing 65,536 inexpensive one-bit processors to achieve supercomputer performance.
These became known as massively parallel computers.
IBM’s Deep Blue used 192 custom processors and defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1996.
A year later, its successor (with 256 processors) defeated Kasparov again in a six-game match.
With the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, the U.S. sought an alternative to nuclear testing,
leading to the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI). ASCI Red, built with Intel,
was the first to achieve 1 TFLOPS (trillion FLOPS) in 1997, using 9,072 Pentium Pro processors.
In 2002, Japan’s Earth Simulator, developed by NEC, briefly led the supercomputer rankings.
However, IBM’s Blue Gene/L reached 135 TFLOPS by 2005 and exceeded 500 TFLOPS by 2007. In 2008,
IBM built Roadrunner, the first computer to exceed 1 petaflop (1,000 TFLOPS), using
AMD Opteron and Cell Broadband Engines (originally designed for the PlayStation 3).

Future of Supercomputing

Supercomputers now allow simulations based on first-principle physics, enabling breakthroughs in
climate analysis, medicine, aerospace engineering, and artificial intelligence.
The biggest challenge remains software optimization—writing programs that efficiently
distribute computations across thousands or millions of processors.
IBM’s support for open-source Linux-based systems has driven supercomputer innovation.
The potential for supercomputers continues to grow, shaping fields from meteorology to quantum physics.
